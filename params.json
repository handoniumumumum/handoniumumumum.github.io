I was really delighted to study encryption and hope to continue working with it in my career.\r\n\r\n##[TE-Vendomatic](http://handoniumumumum.github.io/TE-Vendomatic/)\r\n\r\nA vending machine made in command line with Java. An assignment through Tech Elevator.\r\n\r\n##[CS50-Game-of-15](http://handoniumumumum.github.io/CS50-Game-of-15/)\r\n\r\nA command-line version of Game of 15, a game which I'm incidentally not very good at. That said, making a version of it made me a little better at it and caused me to think about pathing algorithms in the context of an auto-solver God mode that I haven't finished implementing. \r\n",
